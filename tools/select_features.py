"""
    Given X,y find the features in X that best predict y where prediction is measured
    with k-fold cross-validation
    
    Chooose a classifier C e.g. logistic regression
    
    Rank individual features by prediction
    
    For n = 1 .. num features -1
        Using best n-tuples of features
        Create n+1 tuples
        Find best using GA
